Short program created in around 2 hours that allows user to input text and have it encrypted in 3 different ways using 3 differetn ciphres, an image cipher, a caesar cipher, and a vigerene cipher. 
The image cihper is the most fun one, it stores the characters as color values and can modify an existing image or create a new one to hide your messgae. 
All ciphers have encryption and decryption functionality.

Reason for coding was I wanted to implement a simple gui on a program.
